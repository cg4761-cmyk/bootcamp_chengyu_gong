# Project Title
Exploiting Uncertainty from Public Economic Data Releases for Short-Term Arbitrage Across Different Markets

**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
In financial markets, major economic data releases (such as CPI, non-farm payrolls, and interest rate decisions) often trigger sharp price movements. These fluctuations may create short-term arbitrage opportunities.

The goal of this project is to explore whether public macroeconomic data releases create short-lived arbitrage opportunities in U.S. equities and cryptocurrency markets, and to further analyze whether, in most cases, the arbitrage direction tends to be long or short.

## Stakeholder & User
- **Stakeholders:** Academic researchers, quantitative research teams, hedge funds, and retail investors. They are interested in whether markets are efficient and whether data releases generate tradeable opportunities in the immediate aftermath.  
- **End Users:** Retail and institutional traders who want to know whether to adjust positions or adopt defensive strategies around data releases.

## Useful Answer & Decision
- **Descriptive:** Show typical volatility patterns in U.S. equities and cryptocurrencies around major economic data releases.  
- **Predictive:** Explore whether different data types (e.g., CPI, employment reports) can predict short-term price direction.  
- **Deliverable:** An event study–based analysis report with charts and conclusions, showing whether arbitrage exists and whether opportunities are more often long or short.

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Historical market data is available (e.g., minute-level U.S. equity data, crypto exchange data).  
- The release times of macroeconomic data are accurate and verifiable. 
- In this project, ‘different markets’ refers specifically to the U.S. equity market and the cryptocurrency market.

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- High-frequency arbitrage opportunities may disappear within milliseconds, making them invisible in public datasets.  
- The 24/7 nature of cryptocurrency markets may lead to different sensitivity and reaction patterns compared to U.S. equities.  
- Data cleaning and synchronization (event time vs. market reaction time) may be challenging.  
- Even when volatility is evident, it may be difficult to determine whether the arbitrage tendency is long or short.
