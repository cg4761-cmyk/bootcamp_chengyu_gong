# Stakeholder Memo

**To:** Quantitative Research Teams and Institutional/Retail Traders  
**From:** Chengyu Gong - NYU MSFE Student \
**Subject:** Short-Term Arbitrage Opportunities from Economic Data Releases  

Major economic data releases—such as CPI, non-farm payrolls, and interest rate decisions—often trigger sharp and rapid price movements in financial markets. While these events may create short-lived arbitrage opportunities, it is unclear whether such opportunities can be systematically captured, and whether they more often favor long or short positioning.  

This project will focus on the U.S. equity market and the cryptocurrency market. Using an event study approach, we will analyze price behavior immediately before and after economic data releases, measure abnormal returns, and test whether directional patterns (long vs. short) emerge.  

The final deliverable will be a concise report with charts and evidence-based conclusions. These findings will help investors and researchers better understand market efficiency and support decision-making around high-impact macroeconomic events.
