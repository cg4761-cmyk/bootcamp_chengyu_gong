# Deliverables README

## Audience
The intended audience is non-technical stakeholders (e.g., managers or decision-makers) who need to understand performance trade-offs without focusing on technical details.

## Format Choice
I chose a **written report (Markdown â†’ PDF)** format.  

## Key Visuals
The report includes three charts stored in the `/images/` folder:

![Chart 1](images/chart1.png)
![Chart 2](images/chart2.png)
![Chart 3](images/chart3.png)

These visuals support the executive summary, assumptions and risks, and sensitivity analysis presented in `final_report.md`.
